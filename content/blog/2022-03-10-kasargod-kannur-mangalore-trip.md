JKK and I have been thinking about going for a small-budget bike trip ever after one year of covid, and I got bored sitting at home. We wanted to work and travel for a while. After one year of planning, we thought of exploring the North Malabar region, namely Kannur, Kasargod and Mangalore.

Since Jishnu's home is in Kannur, it was easy for us to start from there and slowly move northwards. So one day in February 2022, I took a train to Payynur from where JKK picked me up, and we went to his house. 


## Kannur
After short rest and breakfast at his house, we started exploring Maniyara(JKK's native). Despite growing up in a small village, I had a very refreshing feeling seeing the beauty of Maniyara, where the population was much less than what i had seen around my place.

After roaming around Maniyara, we moved to our first workatation place, an Airbnb house in Edayilakkadu set next to a lake with a beautiful view. Edayilakkadu is a water-locked island with only two roads connecting it to the mainland. The place is also near the Arabian sea, where you have lovely unexplored beaches with almost no crowd where you can sit and look at the skies all night or count the waves. We also visited small harbours in the village with virtually no road to give accessibility.

Later the next day, we visited a mangrove nursery in the middle of the lake, which you can reach using a pedal boat or kayak. Once you get to the middle portion, you can step out of the kayak and walk within the marshy swamp with water to your knees. We had a quality in the area, so we met different friends and families who came to the place. The ride from Airbnb to this place was mesmerising, with views of coconut trees leaning towards the lake.

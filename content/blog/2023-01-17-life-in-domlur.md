I have been an avid fan of aviation. I can watch any number of take-offs and landings without getting bored. Luckily this time, when I am staying in Domlur, Indigo's 6E 8008 has been training flights from HAL airport, which is just behind the place I stay.
Now it gives me enough satisfaction sleeping, hearing the noise of engines powering up and taking off every 15 - 20mins.

[6E 8008](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/IGO8008) is a training flight used for base check.

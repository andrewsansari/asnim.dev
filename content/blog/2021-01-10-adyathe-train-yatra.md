The oldest train memory I have traveling in a train was when I travelled from Kayamkulam to Trivandrum in early part of 2000s to visit my mom's relatives in Trivandrum. 

Kayamkulam railway station still looks the same except it now has sun roofs. Even the food stall looks the same from my vague memory, except it is issues currently.


This was one of my exciting journeys as a kid who always had to get used to getting stuck at the railway cross for all my access to highways. But this time, enjoying the perspective of how these railway crosses look from inside a trainâ€”figuring out if I had already passed through these crosses by road.

One of the scenes I missed from that journey was of a lush green village where the train slowed or stopped for some reason, and looked out the window; I could see abandoned brown railway wheels lying in the lush green grass mat. 
Whenever I travel to Trivandrum, I look for this view, but I can never find it; maybe it is due to the long 100 km stretch I cover and cant scan every place, or perhaps it could be partly left in my memory from some dreams I had. Who knows !!!!

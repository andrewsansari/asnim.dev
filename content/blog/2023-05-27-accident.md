I have been driving Cars and Bikes since 2014 Feb 21st. I had an accident on May 27th, 2023, hopefully, my last.

On the 27th, my friend and I were, driving a Royal Enfield on 100 feet road Indiranagar when our bike tyre got stuck in a gap between the road and footpath, and we fell. I got bruised, of course.

What I want to note down here is not about the event of the accident in particular, but the thought process we had in our mind between the time we realised we were going to fall and we fell completely.

I don't know why. We didn't try to adjust for the fall by straightening our hands or adjusting to reduce the impact. We were just like Aah, it is okay to fall. We didn't even bother to check if we were bruised, although I had significant pain. I wonder why I didn't bother to check until i reached home after riding another 2 km.

At first, I thought it was just my problem, but when I spoke about it to my friend who fell with me, he shared the same thoughts.

Now I am curious to know if it is just us or others who have also met with accidents.

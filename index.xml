I enquired with my relationship manager. Though this is possible without getting a savings account for her, my manager insisted on getting a bank account to meet their targets which I agreed to, and they sent one representative to my house to get this done.

Kayamkulam railway station still looks the same, with sunroofs now. Even the small food stall seems the same from my vague memory.
This journey excited the juvenile me, who invariably used to get stuck at the railway cross for all my to and fro school journeys.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://asnim.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/about/</guid><description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m Asnim P Ansari

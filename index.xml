My cousin Anzal used to live near this restaurant; he introduced me to this place. The Idili and coffee here is my all-time favourite in Bangalore. I have been to many Kannadiga and Tamil Veg restaurants in Bangalore. But nothing beats the soft fluffy Idily these people sell.

I can watch any number of take-offs and landings without getting bored. Luckily this time, when I am staying in Domlur, Indigo&amp;rsquo;s 6E 8008 has been training flights from HAL airport, which is just behind the place I stay. Now it gives me enough satisfaction sleeping, hearing the noise of engines powering up and taking off every 15 - 20mins.
6E 8008 is a training flight used for base check.</description></item><item><title>Paid apps</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2020-01-10-paid-apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2020-01-10-paid-apps/</guid><description>I pay for the following apps&amp;hellip;

The background is the view of the Albanian Alps.
Though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stay there for much. I definitely want to go back there sometime later to spend a vacation.</description></item><item><title>What I wish I had known when I was 15 years.</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-12-27-what-i-wish-knew-when-i-was-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-12-27-what-i-wish-knew-when-i-was-15/</guid><description>15s is the age at which most people write their 10th-grade exams in India. After that, due to community pressure, most of the students opt for either medicine or engineering entrance exam coaching. I was also one such kid, except I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any pressure from my parents to pick one of these. Their only demand was that whichever stream I chose, I excel in the same.
One thing I would do differently in my life if i could go back in time to the point I was enjoying my 10th vacation is to make sure to visit a few Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 engineering campuses.</description></item><item><title>Internships</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-12-25-internship/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-12-25-internship/</guid><description>There are several reasons why computer science students may benefit from completing an internship during their college years:
Gaining practical experience: An internship allows students to apply the concepts and skills they have learned in the classroom to real-world projects and problems. This can help them develop a deeper understanding of the field and learn how to apply their knowledge in a professional setting.
Building a professional network: Internships provide an opportunity for students to network with professionals in the industry and build relationships that can lead to future job opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Goto Resources</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-11-20-goto-resources/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-11-20-goto-resources/</guid><description>Podcasts The Knowledge Project Podcast Andrew Huberman Finance Personal finance notes from Zerodha Varsity Term Insurance details from Ditto Options Trading from Sensibull</description></item><item><title>Product Ideas to improve your life</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-12-27-tech-product-ideas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-12-27-tech-product-ideas/</guid><description>Cliboard sharing for android and linux Instead of using my whatsapp as the copy paste tool to transfer notes in between.

Looking back on my school/college days, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about what I did there, including studying and hobby projects that I built, but what I do remember is
A solo trip to Kochi when I was in 11th My first trip to Chennai and IITM with Anzal My two trips to IITB through Konkan railways with my college friends Trip to Kanyakumari the day before my chemistry University exam Trips to Wayanad, Kozhikode, NITC etc.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://asnim.dev/contact/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/contact/</guid><description>I am a bit picky and continuously limit whom I spend time with.I prefer in-person conversation, particularly going for a drive or sitting and having a meal or coffee together.
People can reach out to me over email and Instagram.

I enquired with my relationship manager. Though this is possible without getting a savings account for her, my manager insisted on getting a bank account to meet their targets which I agreed to, and they sent one representative to my house to get this done.
Once he came and finished his document collection steps, he asked me whether I was looking for any investment schemes or income schemes.</description></item><item><title>Jordan Immigration experience</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-10-21-jordan-immgration-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-10-21-jordan-immgration-experience/</guid><description>I went to Jordan for a ten-day vacation on Oct 2022. With an Indian Passport, there is no need to get the visa prior as you can use the Visa on Arrival facility provided by the country. Also, if you get a Jordan pass before reaching Jordan, it includes your 30days tourist visa fees, too (provided you stay for 4nights at least, otherwise, they will charge you the prices once you go for exit immigration).</description></item><item><title>Kannur - Kasargod - Mangalore workation</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-03-10-kasargod-kannur-mangalore-trip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2022-03-10-kasargod-kannur-mangalore-trip/</guid><description>JKK and I have been thinking about going for a small-budget bike trip ever after one year of covid, and I got bored sitting at home. We wanted to work and travel for a while. After one year of planning, we thought of exploring the North Malabar region, namely Kannur, Kasargod and Mangalore.
Since Jishnu&amp;rsquo;s home is in Kannur, it was easy for us to start from there and slowly move northwards.</description></item><item><title>First train journey memories</title><link>https://asnim.dev/blog/2021-01-10-adyathe-train-yatra/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/blog/2021-01-10-adyathe-train-yatra/</guid><description>My oldest train memory of travelling in a train was when I travelled from Kayamkulam to Trivandrum in the early 2000s to visit my maternal relatives in Trivandrum.
Kayamkulam railway station still looks the same, with sunroofs now. Even the small food stall seems the same from my vague memory.
This journey excited the juvenile me, who invariably used to get stuck at the railway cross for all my to and fro school journeys.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://asnim.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asnim.dev/about/</guid><description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m Asnim P Ansari
